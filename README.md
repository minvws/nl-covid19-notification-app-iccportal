## Development & Contribution process

The core team works on the repository in a private fork (for reasons of compliance with existing processes) and will share its work as often as possible.

If you plan to make non-trivial changes, we recommend to open an issue beforehand where we can discuss your planned changes.
This increases the chance that we might be able to use your contribution (or it avoids doing work if there are reasons why we wouldn't be able to use it).
